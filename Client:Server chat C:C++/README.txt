To compile:
	g++ chatserve.cpp -o test1	gcc clientside.c -o test2	to run:	open up 2 terminal windows
	./test1 30020	./test2 127.0.0.1 30020	 	The client can start typing first. Then the server can type back. the quit the client can type ctrl-c in the terminal. or type /quit. If the client disconnect a new client can reconnect.A lot of know issues. I did realize server had to be written in Cpp so there are lots of known bugs. like the names displaying incorrectly and double messages being sent. and the chat on the client starts in a new line.
